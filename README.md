# TemporalSent
Built temporal intent classification and churn prediction models using Sentence-T5 embeddings with CatBoost; lifted F1 score by 26%.
# ⏱️ TemporalSent – Temporal User Modeling & Query Intent Forecasting

**TemporalSent** is a machine learning project focused on modeling user behavior over time using temporal query intent classification and churn prediction. It supports real-time click-through rate (CTR) ranking and session-level scoring through advanced embeddings and time-aware modeling.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast user churn and classify query intent (navigational, transactional) over time using deep semantic representations and structured behavior traces. It leverages sentence-level embeddings and temporal context to support ranking decisions in large-scale ML pipelines.

## 🧠 Features
